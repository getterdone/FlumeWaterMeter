I ended up using bits of this and that, some custom tweaks here and there, and after a lot of log.debug statements using web Smartthings IDE that at times provides zero stack tracing I created this Flume frankenstein app...Again enjoy..
First github contribution too woohoo, more to come, stay tuned.
